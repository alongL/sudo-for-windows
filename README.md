# sudo-for-windows

When I use the NSSM to install a program as service, It requires administrator privilege serval timesã€‚

When I want to use batch file to acquire administrator privilege to run serval  .bat file, it failed.

So, this is a good tool!

You can run serval exe or bat file by one command,  It requires administrator privilege only once.

Just use "sudo  commandA  commandB ..."
